Problem 2.2 
Provide a short discussion on why you believe your GUI is appropriate
for the database you have decided to build. Describe it in terms
of the intent of the database and the types of queries and updates
you expect to be most important to its users.

1. Users should be able to add a new phone to the database
 (insert into statement is needed)

2. Users should be able to update a phone in the database
So if my phone is stolen or lost or I found it again
then I should be able to change the status.
Also if the model number was incorrect then I should be able to correct it.
 (update set statement is needed)
 
3. If I get rid of my phone I should be able to delete it.
	(delete from statement is needed)

4. In #1-2 I should be given only a list of models to choose from.
	(select from models statement is needed)

5. I should be able to double click on a phone and check the specs.
	(Select from with join statement are needed)

6. I should be able to search my phone by IMIE
	and I should also be able to see all phones.
	(select where statement is needed)
	Also should be able to see specs of the model(s) the phone is.
	(Select from where with join statement are needed)

7. I should be able to search any model by model name
	and I should also be able to see all models.
	(select where statement is needed)
	Also should be able to see specs of the model(s).
	(Select from with join statement are needed)

8. We should not be able to delete or add or update model information as that
	is provided by a manufacture and can not be changed we can only buy a phone of it.

My GUI allows #1-8 to be fulfilled
